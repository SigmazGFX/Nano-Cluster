# Nano-Cluster
This project was built to monitor the criticl stats of my 1969 Subaru 360
Only the bare essentials were avaialble to the base model so fancy things like temperature sensors and tachometers were considered non essential.

Based on an Arduino pro mini, a cheapo RTC module and .96" OLED display.
This cluster was designed to display B+ volatge, RPM, Temp, LC1 wideband or narrowband o2. oh and even display the current time..
I believe you'll need to compile it on ~ IDE 1.5 becasue 1.6.5 throws an error pertaining to the bittmap masking methods Im using for the animated screen overlays.

I'll write a better description later..
